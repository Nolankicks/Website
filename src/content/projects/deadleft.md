Dead 4 Left is a zombie horde shooter. The goal is the kill the most amount of zombies and surive the longest!


I first made Dead 4 Left in s&box when I first learned programming. The first version was never wrote well, it had issues and ran bad. I felt bad for having such a bad game with a decent amount of players, so I remote it.

The rewrite took about 2 days of work and I think it came out pretty well, besides the ui which can use some work.
