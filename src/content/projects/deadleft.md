I first made Dead 4 Left in s&box when I first learned programming. The first version was never wrote well, it had issues and ran bad. I felt bad for having such a bad game with a decent amount of players, so I remote it.

Going into the rewrite I wanted to use the [Game Events Library](https://sbox.game/facepunch/libevents) from Facepunch. I've used it a bit in the past, but I wanted to give it a good shot here.

I also used the [Shrimple Character Controller](https://sbox.game/fish/scc) from the good guys at Small Fish. There were a few issues using it, but [Small Fish](https://smallfi.sh/) were quick to fix them.

The rewrite took about 2 days of work and I think it came out pretty well, besides the ui which can use some work.
