I felt like redoing my website, it was kinda shit before. Now it's less shit, and it has blogs. I heard some good things about [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
Ever since I wrote a bot for my discord I've been wanting to jump into web dev.

I've been told Tailwind CSS is a great lib, so I added that. I'm used to normal CSS, so it took some time getting used to. After some time I got better at using it and realised how helpful it really is.

The hardest part for me was the Github pages deployment. I know it sounds dumb, but I had some config issues in my package.json and svelte.config.js. After I got some help sorting them out, it's been smooth sailing.

<Header title="Blogs" />

I saw some of the other people in the s&box community using markdown blogs. Once you setup everything, it becomes very [shrimple](https://smallfi.sh). Creating a blog is as easy as creating a markdown file and adding some meta data. Because of [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/) I can use svelte components right inside the markdown file.

I enjoyed the overall experience of using svelte and would reccomend it. Shout out to matek and duston for their refrence code from their websites.
I plan to post more blogs on here about whatever.
